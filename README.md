# üë©‚Äçüè≠ Kelcius
KEl¬∞Cius is a web application through which you can obtain the contact temperature of three metallic walls in series, based on heat flux equations. This is done through three main variables: the constants of calorific conductivity from different materials, the rate of generation of heat, and the contact resistance. The app was developed through JavaScript and HTML, which also leverages a database through the use of MySQL, in which material properties such as the thermal conductivity constant and the color codes of the walls could be customized, letting the user have control of the metals that were used in their experiment.

- Interactive Canvas dynamism for the temperature gradient display, which leverages the p5.js library.
- Remote hosting of the website through InfinityFree.
- Usage of a MySQL database through freemysqlhosting.net
- Dynamic PHP metal selector.
- Dynamic, multidevice application through the usage of Bootstrap 5.

This application is highly useful to simplify the calculations for temperature profiles for metallurgic engineers as this automates having to solve differential equations by hand. This is useful for case studies such as optimizing metal heating in an industrial oven or monitoring the temperature of metallic components during their movement in a transportation machine.

The source code for SightGeek is added to this repository and can be found in the folders inside it. To run the project, download all items from the repository into the same directory and click on "SimCalor.html". The application should run in your local directory.


*This project was done with the collaboration of my classmates Rodrigo Moreno Plascencia, Rodrigo B√°rcena Ramos, and Bruno Palacios Cacho.
