# üë©‚Äçüè≠ Kelcius
KEl¬∞Cius is a web application through which you can obtain the contact temperature of three metallic walls in series, based on heat flux equations. This is done through three main variables: the constants of calorific conductivity from different materials, the rate of generation of heat, and the contact resistance. The app was developed through JavaScript and HTML, which also leverages a database through the use of MySQL, in which material properties such as the thermal conductivity constant and the color codes of the walls could be customized, letting the user have control of the metals that were used in their experiment.

- Interactive Canvas dynamism for the temperature gradient display, which leverages the p5.js library.
- Remote hosting of the website through InfinityFree.
- Usage of a MySQL database through freemysqlhosting.net
- Dynamic PHP metal selector.
- Dynamic, multidevice application through the usage of Bootstrap 5.
